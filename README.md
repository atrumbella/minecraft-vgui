# *minecraft-vgui*

Minecraft, but in 1998 - a resource pack emulating Half-Life 1's VGUI feel.

# 

### The How and Why
**minecaft-vgui** is a resource pack aiming to reskin Minecraft's UI to that of games based on the GoldSrc engine.
It is part of our efforts to port the now-iconic Half-Life 1 VGUI User Interface style to as many fronts as possible.

### Installation
You can install this resource pack like you would any other - dragging the folder into the resource packs directory,
usually accessible under `C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks` or by clicking *Open Pack Folder* on the resource pack selection screen.
